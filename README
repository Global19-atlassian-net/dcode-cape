CAPE provides a computational method to quantify the probability of genetic variants
disrupting major transcription factors binding in a given cellular context. We
established a support vector machine by utilizing both sequence information and
transcription factor expression information. This computational approach outperforms
current existing methods even when only incorporating sequence information.
